    "In this lesson, we will take two fairly simple problems - gender classification and age classification from an up-close image of a person. But instead of making two different models, your task will be to make one model that does both of these tasks. Moreover, you will then analyze the model from the ethical point of view and see what sort of dangers and caveats such models can have."
